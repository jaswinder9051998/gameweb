Below is a high-level, detail-oriented plan for how you could structure and implement this 2-player online lobby puck-throwing game on a website (and ideally for mobile). **No code** is provided, but this plan should give a coding agent enough direction to begin development.

## 1. **Game Overview**

1. **Basic Concept**  
   - Two players take turns placing and launching “pucks” on a 2D board.  
   - A puck is placed by the user touching/clicking on the screen at a valid point, then “charging” the puck by holding down. During this charge, the puck rotates in a circular path around the initial touch point.  
   - On release, the puck is launched. The longer the charge, the stronger (and more “wobbly”) the puck’s eventual velocity.  
   - The puck bounces off walls until it comes to rest.  
   - The next player does the same, but **cannot** place a puck within a certain radius `r` of any existing opponent’s puck.  
   - Points are gained by hitting the opponent’s puck(s) with higher speed collisions.  
   - After a certain number of pucks are placed (or if there is no valid space left), the player with the highest points wins.

2. **Intended Platforms**  
   - Web-based (playable in a browser).  
   - Mobile-friendly layout (touch-based interactions).  

3. **Key Features**  
   - Real-time or turn-based two-player gameplay.  
   - Visual indicators for areas where the user cannot place a new puck (the “no-go” zones around the opponent’s pucks).  
   - Bounce physics and collision detection.  
   - Scoring system based on collision force.

## 2. **Core Mechanics**

1. **Puck Placement**  
   - **Input**: Player taps/clicks on the board to select a point.  
   - **Validation**: The chosen point must not be within radius `r` of any existing opponent puck.  
   - **Visual Indicator**:  
     - Show a circle (with radius `r`) around each opponent puck.  
     - These circles should be visible so the user knows where they **cannot** place their puck.

2. **Charging and Release**  
   - **Rotation Mechanism**:  
     - Once the user taps and holds, the puck is conceptually “tethered” to the chosen point.  
     - The puck starts rotating around that point (center of rotation = initial tap).  
     - The rotation can be at a constant angular velocity or increasing in speed over time, depending on the design choice.  
   - **Charge Strength**:  
     - The longer the user holds, the greater the eventual launch speed.  
     - “Wobbliness” can be interpreted as random slight variations in the puck’s final trajectory angle or speed if the user holds it too long.  
   - **Release**:  
     - On release, the puck’s velocity is determined by the rotation speed and angle at that moment.  
     - Possibly incorporate a “max charge” limit to avoid infinitely powerful launches.

3. **Movement and Bouncing**  
   - **Physics Model**: 2D plane with friction or drag so the puck eventually comes to rest.  
   - **Bounce**: Elastic collision with the walls (i.e., reflection).  
   - **Friction**: The puck slows down gradually until it stops.  

4. **Collisions Between Pucks**  
   - **Collision Detection**:  
     - Use bounding circles or a physics library to detect when two pucks overlap.  
   - **Collision Response**:  
     - Standard 2D elastic collision.  
     - Adjust velocities of both pucks based on mass (likely identical for all pucks, simplifying the math).  
     - The strength of the impact can be calculated from the relative velocity of the colliding pucks.  
   - **Scoring**:  
     - Award points to the attacking puck’s owner based on collision strength.  
     - If multiple collisions occur, each collision can add points.

5. **Game End Conditions**  
   - **Number of Pucks**: After each player has placed a certain number of pucks, the game ends.  
   - **No Space Left**: If a player cannot find a valid placement (the entire board is within radius `r` of opponent pucks), the game ends.  
   - **Winner**: Player with the higher score at the end is declared the winner.

## 3. **Game Flow**

1. **Lobby Creation**  
   - Player 1 creates a game lobby.  
   - Player 2 joins the lobby.  
   - A game session is established on the server with a unique game ID.  

2. **Turn Management**  
   - The server enforces turn order: Player 1 goes first, then Player 2, and so on.  
   - The server only accepts input from the active player.  

3. **Placement Phase**  
   - The active player sees the board with all existing pucks.  
   - The restricted zones (radius `r` around opponent pucks) are highlighted.  
   - The player taps/clicks a valid point and starts charging the puck.  
   - On release, the puck’s final velocity and direction are computed and transmitted to the server.  

4. **Movement/Collision Phase**  
   - The puck moves and bounces in real-time (or near real-time) until it comes to rest.  
   - Collisions with walls and other pucks are processed.  
   - The server updates positions and velocities.  
   - The server updates scores based on collision impacts.  
   - Once the puck is at rest (velocity ~ 0), the server signals the end of the turn.  

5. **Next Turn or Game End**  
   - If the puck limit isn’t reached and there is still valid space, the turn switches to the other player.  
   - Otherwise, the game ends and final scores are displayed.

## 4. **Technical Architecture**

1. **Front-End**  
   - **Framework**: Use a standard web framework (e.g., React, Vue, or plain HTML5/JS for simplicity).  
   - **Canvas/Rendering**:  
     - HTML5 Canvas or a 2D rendering library (e.g., Phaser, PixiJS) to draw the board, pucks, and highlight restricted zones.  
     - Keep track of the user’s finger/mouse position to draw the rotating puck.  
   - **UI Elements**:  
     - Scoreboard.  
     - Turn indicator.  
     - Clear highlight circles for restricted zones.  

2. **Back-End**  
   - **Server**: Node.js, Python, or any server platform that can handle real-time or turn-based state.  
   - **WebSockets or REST**:  
     - If you want near real-time movement sync, use WebSockets for sending puck positions, collisions, and state updates.  
     - If it’s turn-based with short real-time movement, you can still do WebSockets to reduce latency.  
   - **Database/State Management**:  
     - For short, ephemeral sessions, in-memory storage might suffice.  
     - If storing game history, use a database (e.g., MongoDB, Redis, SQL).  
   - **Lobby Management**:  
     - Endpoints or socket channels to create/join a lobby.  
     - Store which players are in each game.  
     - Identify active player.  

3. **Physics Engine**  
   - **Option 1**: Use an existing 2D physics library (e.g., matter.js, planck.js, or a minimal custom solution).  
   - **Option 2**: Implement simple circle-based collision detection and response.

## 5. **Data Structures & Key Variables**

1. **Game State**  
   - **Board Dimensions**: `(width, height)`  
   - **List of Pucks**: Each puck has:  
     - `ownerId` (player 1 or 2)  
     - `(x, y)` position  
     - `(vx, vy)` velocity  
     - `radius` (for collisions)  
     - `isAtRest` (boolean)  
   - **Score**: `scorePlayer1`, `scorePlayer2`  
   - **Turn**: `activePlayerId`  

2. **Lobby State**  
   - `lobbyId`  
   - `player1Id`, `player2Id`  
   - `isGameActive`  

3. **Placement Constraints**  
   - `prohibitedZones`: list of circles (center = each opponent puck’s position, radius = `r`)  
   - On front-end, you can check if the chosen point is inside any prohibited zone before sending to the server.

4. **Collision Parameters**  
   - `collisionCoefficient` (elasticity factor)  
   - `frictionCoefficient` (reduces velocity over time)  

5. **Scoring Parameters**  
   - `collisionForceToPointsRatio`: how to convert collision strength to points.

## 6. **Detailed Steps / Logic Flow**

### 6.1 **Setup & Lobby**  
1. **Create Lobby**  
   - Player 1 clicks “Create Game”.  
   - Server generates `lobbyId` and sets Player 1 as the host.  
2. **Join Lobby**  
   - Player 2 enters the `lobbyId` or uses a matchmaking system.  
   - Server pairs Player 2 with Player 1.  

### 6.2 **Initialize Game**  
1. **Game State Creation**  
   - Set board dimensions.  
   - Initialize empty puck list.  
   - Set scores to 0.  
   - Set `activePlayerId` to Player 1.  
   - Set `puckCountPlayer1 = 0`, `puckCountPlayer2 = 0`.  

2. **Send State to Clients**  
   - Each client now has the same initial state.  

### 6.3 **Placement & Charging**  
1. **Client-Side Input**  
   - Player attempts to place a new puck by clicking/tapping on the board.  
   - Client checks local data to ensure the point is not within `r` of an opponent puck.  
   - If valid, a “ghost puck” or placeholder puck is rendered at that location.  

2. **Charging Mechanic**  
   - While the player holds down, show a rotation animation around the tap point.  
   - A “power meter” can be displayed (e.g., a bar or a numeric value).  
   - Internally track the angle of rotation and the power level.  

3. **Release & Launch**  
   - On release, compute final velocity vector based on the angle and power.  
   - Send an action message to the server:  
     - `action = "LAUNCH_PUCK"`  
     - `position = (startX, startY)`  
     - `velocity = (vx, vy)`  
     - `owner = activePlayerId`  

### 6.4 **Server Validation & State Update**  
1. **Check Turn**  
   - Confirm the message is from the `activePlayerId`. If not, ignore.  

2. **Place Puck in State**  
   - Create a new puck object with the given position and velocity.  
   - Add to the game’s puck list.  
   - Increment that player’s puck count.  

3. **Movement Simulation**  
   - The server either:  
     - (a) Steps through the physics simulation at short intervals (e.g., 30–60 fps) for the next few seconds, or  
     - (b) Uses a physics engine that automatically updates positions.  
   - During each update:  
     - Check collisions with walls.  
       - If collision with a wall, reflect velocity.  
     - Check collisions with other pucks.  
       - If collision, calculate new velocities for both pucks.  
       - Calculate collision force → update score.  
     - Apply friction to reduce velocity over time.  

4. **End of Movement**  
   - When the new puck’s speed is below a threshold, mark it as “at rest”.  
   - The server sends final positions, updated velocities, and updated scores to both players.  
   - The server sets `activePlayerId` to the other player.  

### 6.5 **Next Turn or Game End**  
1. **Check Puck Limits**  
   - If `puckCountPlayer1 + puckCountPlayer2` < `maxPucks`, continue to next turn.  
2. **Check Space Availability**  
   - If the next player cannot place a puck anywhere outside the restricted zones, the game ends.  
3. **End of Game**  
   - Compare `scorePlayer1` and `scorePlayer2`.  
   - Declare winner.

## 7. **Visual & UX Considerations**

1. **Board Layout**  
   - Keep it relatively minimal so the user focuses on puck placement.  
   - Display a boundary or “wall” to indicate the playable area.  

2. **Indicating Turn**  
   - Show the active player’s name or color highlight.  
   - Disable or hide placement controls for the inactive player.  

3. **No-Go Zones**  
   - Draw translucent circles around opponent pucks to indicate restricted placement areas.  

4. **Collision Feedback**  
   - Briefly flash or animate the pucks on collision.  
   - Show a small floating text with points gained.  

5. **Scoring Display**  
   - A simple scoreboard with each player’s name and points.  

---

## 8. **Performance & Optimization**

1. **Physics Computations**  
   - Keep them on the server to ensure fairness and consistent results.  
   - The client can do a “prediction” or “visual approximation” for smoother animations, but final positions come from the server.  

2. **Network**  
   - If the turn-based approach is used, real-time updates are only crucial for the puck’s movement.  
   - WebSockets can push frequent position updates to the other player.  

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Use responsive scaling for the board.  
   - Touch gestures for placement and hold.  

4. **Minimizing Data Transfer**  
   - Only transmit essential events (launch puck, collision updates, final states).  
   - Keep track of partial updates (e.g., incremental positions) if you want smoother animations on the client.  

---

## 9. **Testing & Iteration**

1. **Unit Testing**  
   - Test collision detection with various velocities and angles.  
   - Test boundary reflections.  
   - Test scoring logic.  

2. **Integration Testing**  
   - Simulate a full game flow: lobby creation, turns, scoring, end condition.  

3. **User Experience Testing**  
   - Ensure the “hold to charge” mechanic is intuitive.  
   - Verify that restricted zones are visually clear and correct.  

4. **Performance Testing**  
   - Check that the game runs smoothly on typical mobile devices and browsers.  

5. **Edge Cases**  
   - Puck placed exactly on the boundary or near corners.  
   - Multiple collisions in quick succession.  
   - No space left for the next player.

## 10. **Future Enhancements**

1. **Multiple Players / Team Play**  
   - Extend to 4 players, or 2v2 teams.  

2. **Power-Ups or Special Pucks**  
   - Add pucks with special properties (e.g., increased bounce, explosion on collision).  

3. **Progression / Ranking**  
   - ELO-like ranking system for frequent players.  

4. **Visual Themes**  
   - Different board skins, puck designs, or animations.

## **Summary**

This plan outlines how to build a 2-player, turn-based, puck-throwing web game with real-time bouncing physics. The key points are:

- **Placement & Turn System**: Prevent overlap with opponent pucks, track whose turn it is.  
- **Charging & Launch**: Mechanic to “power up” and then release the puck with a velocity.  
- **Physics & Collisions**: Real-time movement, bouncing off walls, collisions that generate points.  
- **Scoring & End Conditions**: Tally collision points, end after a set number of pucks or no more valid space.  

Following this design document, a coding agent should have sufficient detail to implement the front-end (rendering, UI, user input) and back-end (lobby management, physics updates, scoring) without ambiguity—**all while avoiding any actual code in this outline**.
