- Turn-based gameplay
- Rope visualization during charging
- Perpendicular launch physics

## Known Issues
- No puck-to-puck collisions yet
- No scoring system implemented
- Need to fine-tune physics values

## Next Steps
1. Implement puck-to-puck collisions
2. Add scoring system based on collision force
3. Add visual feedback for collisions
4. Add scoreboard UI

## Notes
- Project started based on gameplan.md specifications
- Initial focus will be on core game mechanics before adding multiplayer functionality
- Basic canvas and puck visualization implemented
- Added charging mechanism with visual indicator
- Implemented wall collisions and friction
- Improved launch mechanics to use perpendicular motion
